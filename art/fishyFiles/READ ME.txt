All of these flps use FL Studio 20.8.3

All the samples i used will be in the same folders as the flps :troll:

FishyTank doesn't require any external plugins

Underwater uses Serum and Nexus 2

Less-Speach is a joke song and i doubt you'll be doing anything with it anyways

Unspeakable uses Pianotone 600 and Nexus 2

Fish Box uses Serum and Nexus 2
