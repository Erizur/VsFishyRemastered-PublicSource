Message from pastel:
All of these flps use FL Studio 20.8.3

All the samples i used will be in the same folders as the flps :troll:

FishyTank doesn't require any external plugins

Underwater uses Serum and Nexus 2

Less-Speach is a joke song and i doubt you'll be doing anything with it anyways

Unspeakable uses Pianotone 600 and Nexus 2

Fish Box uses Serum and Nexus 2

Matching from t5mpler:
Walkeing uses a lot of external plugins (Nexus 2, Serum, and a lot others) lol
the samples are included with the flp though.
